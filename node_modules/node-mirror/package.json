  "readme": "## Description\n\nA IDE build around CodeMirror.net.  \nIf you dont know CodeMirror.net, please check it out. Its a great Project.  \nThis projects aim is to follow the CodeMirror philosophy of pluginability and simplistic approach to give you a full (Web)Developer IDE.  \nSo all you need is:  \n- a Computer (i recommend a unix machine) - update 0.0.15 it runs in win  \n- node.js and the knowledge how to start it  \n- this Project  \n\nand you have answered the Question about which Editor to choose.  \nYou will be able to edit your code from anywhere you want. if you dont like the colors you just change em. if support for a mimetype is missing you can just add it.  \nYou will never again have to be frustrated about a missing feature within your IDE because you can just add it. At least if you know JavaScript.  \n  \nFor every Content Type where a CodeMirror Mode exists, a CodeMirror instance will be opened. Also every content Type starting with text/* will be opened using CodeMirror.  \nFor all other files there is a download button.\n\nfeatures:  \n - view / edit all content/types supported by CodeMirror.net  \n - view / edit all files in text mode or download them  \n - html tester / analyzer  \n - .less tester / .less online help / save your .less file immediately as .css file  \n - awesome hexeditor  \n - integrated pegjs parser debugger  \n - download directories as zip files (buggy)   \n \n\n## Security  \n  \npass username and password to secure your local files from being hacked  \n\n\n## Usage  \n\n`\nnpm install node-mirror  \n`  \n  \n`\nnode node_modules/node-mirror/bin/nodeMirror.js --port 3000 --dir /home/sol/projects --username sol --password mysupersecretpassword\n`  \n\n`\nhttp://127.0.0.1:3000/  \n`\n\nthis is still beta. but i am using this for development so you can expect more.  \ni am getting pretty comfortable with this project. maybe i will release 0.1 soon.\n\nthe npm distribution is a release build  \n\ncheck out my git page to get the development version which you can use to customize node-mirror  \nthere is a build script that lets you build your own node-mirror  \n\n## License\n\nBSD - maybe i will relicense it under MIT when i have found out what the differences are\n",
